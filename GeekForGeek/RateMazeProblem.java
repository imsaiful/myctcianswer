/*Rat in a Maze | Backtracking-2
We have discussed Backtracking and Knightâ€™s tour problem in Set 1. Let us discuss Rat in a Maze as another example problem that can be solved using Backtracking.
A Maze is given as N*N binary matrix of blocks where source block is the upper left most block i.e., maze[0][0] and destination block is lower rightmost block i.e., maze[N-1][N-1]. A rat starts from source and has to reach the destination. The rat can move only in two directions: forward and down.
In the maze matrix, 0 means the block is a dead end and 1 means the block can be used in the path from source to destination. Note that this is a simple version of the typical Maze problem. For example, a more complex version can be that the rat can move in 4 directions and a more complex version can be with a limited number of moves.

Following is an example maze.

 Gray blocks are dead ends (value = 0). 


Following is binary matrix representation of the above maze.

                {1, 0, 0, 0}
                {1, 1, 0, 1}
                {0, 1, 0, 0}
                {1, 1, 1, 1}
Following is a maze with highlighted solution path.



Following is the solution matrix (output of program) for the above input matrx.

                {1, 0, 0, 0}
                {1, 1, 0, 0}
                {0, 1, 0, 0}
                {0, 1, 1, 1}
 All enteries in solution path are marked as 1.*/
